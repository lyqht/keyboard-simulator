This project is created for the 🎄 Advent of CSS - Day 4 - Computer Keyboard using the [Astro](https://github.com/withastro/astro/)'s Preact template.

💡 A useful `json` file containing the keyboard buttons location sorted by their row number can be found at `src/components/keyboard-button-locations.json`.
